# Dog Breed Identification

## Determine the breed of a dog in an image

## Problem statement:

Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

In this playground competition, you are provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image categorization. How well you can tell your Norfolk Terriers from your Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per class, you might find the problem more, err, ruff than you anticipated.

## Project Description:

*  The notebook expalins step by step process to build CNN model that can identify the breed of the dog from image
*   We will use Fastai libraries, Fastai uses Pytorch as a background deep learning framework.

*   I encourge the visitor to read to end of this notebook to gain complete understanding of building world class image classifier using deep learning
*   Special thanks to Jeremy Howard for his awosome training on Fastai
